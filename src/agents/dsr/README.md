# Reinforcement Learning using Deep Successor Features
(Implementation based on on the paper "Deep Successor Reinforcement Learning" T. Kulkarni, et al., 2016)

Successor Representations factorize reward and world dynamics and thereby increase the sensitivity to reward changes and the ability to extract bottleneck states (e.g. subgoals in Heirarchical Learning)
